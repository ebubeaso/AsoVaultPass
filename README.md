# AsoVaultPass
This is my microservice password manager web application. Here is what it comprises of:
- MongoDB database for managing user info for the application.
- MariaDB database for storing the information securely.
- Python Flask as a microservice backend for managing the CRUD actions to the MariaDB database.
- Node.js Express backend as the login and register microservice for the application.
- React frontend using TypeScript and styled components
The microservices will be broken up into separate containers to provide a containerized environment.
